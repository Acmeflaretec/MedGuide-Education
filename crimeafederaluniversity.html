                    <p><strong>Benefits of Medical Education in Russia (MBBS in Russia) for Indian students</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>1. Comprehensive Education</strong></p>
                    <p>Russia has always been known for training physicians and specialists in natural sciences. The Russian
                        Medical Universities have always secured a place among Top Medical Universities. Russia is the part
                        of the European Credit Transfer System which makes various Universities and colleges of the rest of
                        Europe easily accessible to the graduates of all the Universities of the Russian Federation. </p>
    
                    <p><strong>2. Excellent Educational Standards</strong></p>
                    <p>Russian Medical Universities boast great infrastructure, laboratories, a large number of hospitals
                        and clinics linked with them in the city, and association with other medical institutions of the
                        country as well as other European and Asian Countries. So, doing MBBS from Russia is at par with
                        world standards.</p>
    
    
                    <p><strong>3. Low Tuition Fee</strong></p>
                    <p>Most Russian Medical Universities are Government Universities, where the cost of education is
                        subsidized by the government which in turn makes the Tuition Fee significantly low as compared to
                        other countries. This makes Studying MBBS in Russia very affordable along with good quality.</p>
    
                    <p><strong>4. A chance to learn the local language and dialect</strong></p>
                    <p>Learning a new language opens new doors and new ways in which a person interacts and thinks about new
                        problems, it has been proven scientifically that a person who speaks more than one language is
                        smarter than their peers. So, moving abroad and getting along with locals will help students learn
                        the local dialect and grow. The Russian Medical Universities also offer special language courses to
                        interested students who wish to study language as a separate course.</p>
    
                    <p><strong>5. The medium of instruction is English</strong></p>
                    <p>Being able to learn a new language is an Advantage, nevertheless, the students who join (MBBS in
                        Russia) are taught in the English Language for the complete duration at Crimea State Medical
                        University. </p>
    
                    <p><strong>6. Well-Equipped Dormitories and Campuses</strong></p>
                    <p>The Crimea State Medical University has hospitals and clinics linked to it along with various
                        departments spread out throughout the city. All the departments are well equipped with all the
                        necessary instruments and apparatuses. The Dormitories are also well equipped with all the necessary
                        facilities such as 24hrs running hot and cold water.</p>
    
                    <p><strong>7. Easy adaption for International Students</strong></p>
                    <p>Since there are a lot of International Students in the University from various countries pursuing
                        various courses in pharmacy, dentistry as well as MBBS from Russia, it is quite easy for new
                        students to adapt and assimilate into new places and culture with the help of a friendly and caring
                        University staff.</p>
                    <p><strong>8. Exposure to New Culture</strong></p>
                    <p>Russia and India have always had a special relationship with each other. Both countries have always
                        embraced each other’s culture with great enthusiasm. So, doing MBBS from Russia will give students
                        exposure to a new and welcoming culture which will help them grow overall.</p>
                    <p><strong>9. Sports</strong></p>
                    <p>The Russian universities provide sports facilities to the students on the university campus and the
                        hostel campus as well. Students always have the opportunity to get involved in sports activities.
                        Students who are studying MBBS in Russia even get a chance to play on the national and international
                        level on behalf of the University.</p>
    
                    <p><strong>10. Exciting and New Life!</strong></p>
                    <p>Student life is the time in an Individual’s life during which one grows at the maximum rate, be it in
                        a physical sense, or mental sense. Studying in a foreign University in a foreign country gives a lot
                        of opportunities to students to meet new people make new friends, grow as an individual developing
                        social and cultural skills far ahead of their peers back home! So, this not only provides
                        educational opportunities but also intellectual opportunities as well.</p>
    
                    <p><strong>The pattern of Education for MBBS in Russia</strong></p>
                    <p>The pattern of Education in Russia is no doubt a little different as compared to India, nevertheless,
                        the Educational quality is at par with International and European Standards. Students who are doing
                        MBBS from Russia study in a group of 15-20 students in a class, which makes the classes all the more
                        interactive and interesting. All the universities providing MBBS in Russia are a part of<strong>the
                            European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS), </strong>), which allows students who
                        have completed their MBBS From Russia, opportunities to pursue further Education in European
                        Countries more easily as compared to their Indian counterparts.</p>
                    <p><strong>Why a student should choose campus/hostel accommodation</strong></p>
                    <p>Since the student is a foreigner and doesn’t know the local language well at least for a year or so,
                        the students are advised to stay in the accommodation facilities provided by the University for the
                        initial years.</p>
                    <p><strong>• Other Advantages: – </strong> Generally, in most of the Medical Universities in Russia, the
                        hostel facilities are available extremely close to the campus where classes are held, which makes it
                        easier for students in terms of commute to the University to attend classes.</p>
                    <p><strong>• Safety: – </strong>Hostels of the medical Universities in Russia are facilitated with 24*7
                        security with all kinds of modern surveillance systems ensuring the safety and wellbeing of the
                        Students.</p>
